## My Development Journey

This project was a significant learning experience in backend development and DevOps. The initial deployment on Railway using Nixpacks presented several dependency challenges, particularly with FFmpeg and Opus. To solve this, I migrated the entire project to a `Dockerfile` deployment, which provided a stable and reliable environment. This process taught me a great deal about containerization, dependency management, and professional deployment workflows.
